  description: Can superconducting coherence peaks form impurity-like ring patterns? And how can such features appear across the entire surface?  We suggest an an amorphous Shiba state located outside the superconducting gap – a Shiba liquid.

- title: "Equivalence of pseudogap and pairing energy in a cuprate high-temperature superconductor"
  image: BSCCO_noise.png
  description: What is the pseudogap and what is the relation between pseudogap and superconductivity? – This is likely the most discussed issue in quantum matter over the last three decades. We report a direct evidence for equivalence of pseudogap and onset energy for electron pairing with our state-of-art electron pair microscope. This may inspire hope for materials with higher Tc.

- title: "Why shot noise does not generally detect pairing in mesoscopic superconducting tunnel junctions"

  description: Can mesoscopic shot noise experiments show the doubling of the charge carriers in a superconductor? Turns out, it's complicated. We investigated this in several different samples, and made predictions as to what is necessary to make this work.

- title: "Single-electron charge transfer into putative Majorana and trivial modes in individual vortices"
  image: imageaward_edited.png
  description: Shot noise has been suggested for a long time as a tell-tale probe for Majorana bound states. We are the first to carry out local tunneling shot noise measurements on the putative vortex Majorana states.
