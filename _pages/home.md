**News: Our group moved to the University of Munich (LMU)!** Join us! 

We are a dynamic research group at [LMU physics](https://www.physik.lmu.de/en/index.html) and at the [Leiden Institute of Physics](http://www.physics.leidenuniv.nl/). 

We have two overarching goals: first, 
**to understand quantum materials**, including strange metals, high-temperature superconductors, and quantum critical electron matter. Second, **to make novel and useful materials** that never existed before, like possible room-temperature superconductors. 
To achieve these goals, we develop new quantum sensing and quantum imaging instrumentation to obtain the key quantum mechanical degrees of freedom. We want to build the perfect instruments to answer the scientific questions we deem most important. 

We are currently building up our instruments right in the center of Munich, in the *Sommerfeldkeller*, where Sommerfeld and Röntgen worked. We will exchange ideas with world class groups working in quantum physics, cold-atom many-body physics, and 2d quantum materials. We are also a proud member of the [SuperC consortium](https://superc2033.com/our-team/).

**We are looking for passionate new PhD students, Postdocs, and Master students to join the team** [(more info)](https://www.allanlab.org/vacancies) **!**
